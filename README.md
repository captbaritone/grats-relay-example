# Grats + Relay Example App

This is an example showing a minimal app using [Grats](https://grats.capt.dev) and [Relay](https://relay.dev/) together.

## Getting Started

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```

This should open a browser window to `http://localhost:1234` where you can see the app running.

To see the GraphiQL Playground, go to `http://localhost:4000/graphql` in your browser.

_Note:_ You may need to refresh the browser since the server may not be ready when the browser opens.
